BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him.\n\nMany of his issues stem from his childhood and issues with his unhappy parents, which the audience is shown through flashbacks.",
